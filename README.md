# LumberHack

A Windows application for hacking the telegram game Lumberjack

Doing this as a toy project for C#, as well as to beat my friends!

It only works on IE so far, because Chrome doesnt work well with the application commands

## WIP

So far we can send key stroke commands to the browser window.

We now need to do some image recognition to determine which key stroke to send
